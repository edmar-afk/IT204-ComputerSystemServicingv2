						  <p>Knowing everyone’s role and being familiar with the responsibility of those roles create efficiency and flexibility. 
                              Ideas for clarifying roles on the team include:<br><br>
                            
                              *Review team members’ roles frequently.<br>
                              *Relate team member expectations to the team’s overall purpose.<br>
                             *Clarify responsibilities when action planning.<br>
                              *Learn what others do on the team.<br>
                              *Figure out ways to help each other.<br><br>

                              Setting aside time to really evaluate what you do and how that impacts (or not) the company you work for is important to understanding the value you and your role have with that organization. Are you a key player on your team? If not, does the role provide opportunities for you to advance toward this?<br>

                                After fully understanding your current role, value within your company, and its possible benefits and setbacks for your future, it’s time to take action. So many people become complacent in their careers and on the job.<br>

                                If after evaluating your overall situation you discover that it’s actually beneficial to step out of your current role—step out of it. Don’t be afraid to follow after what your heart truly desires.

						   <h2><span>Relationship and Responsibility</h2>
                        </div>
						<div class="full">
						  <p>Being a mutually evolving process, a relationship requires team members to be dependent on each other. Every individual should develop a level of trust for each other in order to be reliable for each other. Some of us just cannot find it easy to entrust a work with another team member or cannot seem to trust what a member can contribute.<br>

                            In order to build trust, the team can hold trust-building talks during meetings every now and then. Self-disclosure is a good strategy for establishing trust with each other. Learning how to open and share a little about you to your teammates will give them a chance to know you as a person.   Inject humor and some fun to be comfortable with each other.<br>
                            
                            Once you start to trust each other as an important member of the team, you will also become easily dependent on each other. With this, a budding relationship is established.<br>
                            
                            Each individual in a team has talents and abilities that can contribute to a solid work relationship which is needed to be productive in the job. As a team, members have to identify who excel in technical expertise, who are keen in problem-solving and decision-making, and who are adept in active listening, giving good feedback, and conflict resolution.<br>
                            
                            Identifying these skills helps a team perform effectively. This is otherwise known as team synergy through a coordinated effort of performing these abilities. Diversities even in skills and talents are common. But sharing these skills for the benefit of the team can build a solid work relationship among the individuals.<br>
                            
                            For a relationship to become healthy, learn to appreciate each other’s talents. Being recognized by fellow colleagues for the effort contributed for the team is heartwarming and rewarding.<br>

                        </div>
						<div class="full">
						  <p>ITypically, in a work setting, every working individual belongs to a team where a group of members work together with similar functions and work description, though not necessarily similar in interests.<br>

                            Also, individuals in a team generate a collaborative effort to achieve common goals, and may need to give up individual autonomy in order to attain those goals. The organization as a whole can make up a team and this component is by far the largest to be called as such.<br>
                            
                            If you are paired up with another work colleague on a project, you are already called a team. Regardless of the population of the members and diversities in a team, building a relationship is a crucially important factor grounded on teamwork.<br>
                            
                            Team members who develop a common strategy in working such as using a discussion in the interaction process or assigning tasks are manifesting teamwork. Individuals work together by sharing individual objectives and eventually come up with a unified goal.<br>
                            
                            Being a part of a team also entails commitment in the job and the responsibility. In order for a team to be harmonious, a good working relationship has to be established..</p>
