						  <p>To complete hardware repairs, it is important to have a toolkit that should contain all of the
                            necessary tools. As you gain experience, you will learn which tools to have available for
                            different types of jobs. Hardware tools are grouped into these four categories:<br>
                            - Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) tools<br>
                            - Hand tools<br>
                            - Cleaning tools<br>
                            - Diagnostic tools<br><br>
                            Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) Tools<br>
                            Static electricity is easily generated by friction on carpets, tile flooring, clothing, hair, fabric,
                            and etc. The friction of moving air alone will charge suspended particles and cause the
                            buildup of static electrical charges on people and objects in the environment. Grounded
                            antistatic work mats used with antistatic wrist straps provide the most basic means for the
                            controlled discharge of electrostatic electricity. Examples of ESD Tools:

						  <p>A hand tool is a device for performing work on a material or a physical system using only
                            hands. The hand tools can be manually used employing force, or electrically powered, using
                            electrical current. Examples of Hand Tools:<br><br>
                            
                            1. Flat head screwdriver – used to loosen or tighten slotted screws.<br>
                            2. Philips head screwdriver – used to loosen or tighten crosshead screws.<br>
                            3. Torx screwdriver - used to loosen or tighten screws that
                            have a star-like depression on the top, a feature that is
                            mainly found on laptop.<br>
                            4. Hex driver – sometimes called a nut driver, is used to
                            tighten nuts in the same way that a screwdriver tightens
                            screws.<br>
                            5. Needle-nose plier – used to hold small parts.

                            The purpose of an antistatic wrist strap is to equalize
                                the electrical charge between you and the equipment.
                                The antistatic wrist strap is a conductor that connects
                                your body to the equipment that you are working on.
                                When static electricity builds up in your body, the
                                connection made by the wrist strap to the equipment, or
                                ground, channels the electricity through the wire that
                                connects the strap.<br><br>
                                The wrist strap has two parts and is easy to wear:
                                1. Wrap the strap around your wrist and secure it
                                using the snap or Velcro. The metal on the back
                                of the wrist strap must remain in contact with your skin at all times.<br>
                                2. Snap the connector at the end of the wire to the wrist strap, and connect the other
                                end either to the equipment or to the same grounding point that the antistatic mat is
                                connected to. The metal skeleton of the case is a good place to connect the wire.
                                When connecting the wire to equipment that you are working on, choose an
                                unpainted metal surface. A painted surface does not conduct the electricity as well as
                                unpainted metal.<br><br>
                                An antistatic mat is slightly conductive. It works by drawing static electricity away from a
                                component and transferring it safely from equipment to a grounding point:<br>
                                1. Lay the mat on the workspace next to or under the computer case.<br>
                                2. Clip the mat to the case to provide a grounded surface on which you can place parts
                                as you remove them from the system.<br>
                                Reducing the potential for ESD reduces the likelihood of damage to delicate circuits or
                                components.

                        </div>
						<div class="full">
						  <p>A technician needs to be able to properly use each tool in the toolkit. This topic covers many
                            of the various hand tools used when repairing computers.<br><br>
                           1. Screws<br>
                            Match each screw with the proper screwdriver. Place the tip of the screwdriver on the head
                            of the screw. Turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten the screw and counterclockwise to
                            loosen the screw.<br>
                            Screws can become stripped if you over-tighten them with a screwdriver. A stripped screw,
                            may get stuck in the screw hole, or it may not tighten firmly. Discard stripped screws.<br><br>
                           2. Flat head screwdriver<br>
                            Use a flat head screwdriver when you are working with a slotted screw. Do not use a flat
                            head screwdriver to remove a Phillips head screw. Never use a screwdriver as a pry bar. If
                            you cannot remove a component, check to see if there is a clip or latch that is securing the
                            component in place.<br>
                            CAUTION: If excessive force is needed to remove or add a component, something is
                            probably wrong. Take a second look to make sure that you have not missed a screw or a
                            locking clip that is holding the component in place. Refer to the device manual or diagram for
                            additional information.<br><br>
                            3. Phillips head screwdriver<br>
                            Use a Phillips head screwdriver with crosshead screws. Do not use this type of screwdriver
                            to puncture anything. This will damage the head of the screwdriver.<br>
                            4. Hex driver<br>
                            Use a hex driver to loosen and tighten bolts that have a hexagonal (six-sided) head. Hex
                            bolts should not be over-tightened because the threads of the bolts can be stripped. Do not
                            use a hex driver that is too large for the bolt that you are using.<br><br>
                            CAUTION: Some tools are magnetized. When working around electronic devices, be sure
                            that the tools you are using have not been magnetized. Magnetic fields can be harmful to
                            data stored on magnetic media. Test your tool by touching the tool with a screw. If the screw
                            is attracted to the tool, do not use the tool.<br>
                            5.Part retriever, Needle-nose pliers, or tweezers<br>
                            The part retriever, needle-nose pliers, and tweezers can be used to place and retrieve parts
                            that may be hard to reach with your fingers. Do not scratch or hit any components when
                            using these tools.<br><br>
                            CAUTION: Pencils should not be used inside the computer to change the setting of switches
                            or to pry off jumpers. The pencil lead can act as a conductor and may damage the computer
                            components.

						<div class="full">
                          <p>Keeping computers clean inside and out is a vital part of a maintenance program. Dirt can
                            cause problems with the physical operation of fans, buttons, and other mechanical
                            components. On electrical components, an excessive buildup of dust will act like an insulator
                            and trap the heat. This insulation will impair the ability of heat sinks and cooling fans to keep
                            components cool, causing chips and circuits to overheat and fail.<br><br>
                            CAUTION: When compressed air is used to clean inside the computer, the air should be
                            blown around the components with a minimum distance of four inches from the nozzle. The
                            power supply and the fan should be cleaned from the back of the case.<br><br>

                            CAUTION: Before cleaning any device, turn it off and unplug the device from the power
                            source<br>
                            Computer Cases and Monitors<br>
                            Clean computer cases and the outside of monitors with a mild cleaning solution on a damp,
                            lint-free cloth. Mix one drop of dishwashing liquid with four ounces of water to create the
                            cleaning solution. If any water drips inside the case, allow enough time for the liquid to dry
                            before powering on the computer<br>

                           6. LCD Screens<br>
                            Do not use ammoniated glass cleaners or any other solution on an LCD screen, unless the
                            cleaner is specifically designed for the purpose. Harsh chemicals will damage the coating on
                            the screen. There is no glass protecting these screens, so be gentle when cleaning them
                            and do not press firmly on the screen<br>.
                            7.CRT Screens<br>
                            To clean the screens of CRT monitors, dampen a soft,
                            clean, lint-free cloth with distilled water and wipe the
                            screen from top to bottom. Then use a soft, dry cloth to
                            wipe the screen and remove any streaking after you have
                            cleaned the monitor.<br>
                            Clean dusty components with a can of compressed air.
                            Compressed air does not cause electrostatic buildup on
                            components. Make sure that you are in a well-ventilated
                            area before blowing the dust out of the computer. A best
                            practice is to wear a dust mask to make sure that you do
                            not breathe in the dust particles.<br>
                            Blow out the dust using short bursts from the can. Never tip the can or use the compressed
                            air can upside down. Do not allow the fan blades to spin from the force of the compressed
                            air. Hold the fan in place. Fan motors can be ruined from spinning when the motor is not
                            turned on.<br><br>
                            8. Component Contacts<br>
                            Clean the contacts on components with isopropyl alcohol. Do not use rubbing alcohol.
                            Rubbing alcohol contains impurities that can damage contacts. Make sure that the contacts
                            do not collect any lint from the cloth or cotton swab. Blow any lint off the contacts with
                            compressed air before reinstallation.<br><br>
                            9. Keyboard<br>
                            Clean a desktop keyboard with compressed air or a small, hand-held vacuum cleaner with a
                            brush attachment.<br><br>
                            CAUTION: Never use a standard vacuum cleaner inside a computer case. The plastic parts
                            of the vacuum cleaner can build up static electricity and discharge to the components. Use
                            only a vacuum approved for electronic components.<br>
                           10. Mouse<br>
                            Use glass cleaner and a soft cloth to clean the outside of the mouse. Do not spray glass
                            cleaner directly on the mouse. If cleaning a ball mouse, you can remove the ball and clean it
                            with glass cleaner and a soft cloth. Wipe the rollers clean inside the mouse with the same
                            cloth. Do not spray any liquids inside the mouse.

						  <p>All tools and equipment must be properly maintained so that workers are not endangered.
                            Regulations require inspections of tools, machines and equipment before use.<br><br>
                            Preventive maintenance is the systematic care and protection of tools, equipment and
                            machines in order to keep them in a safe, usable condition, limit downtime and extend
                            productivity. We must always be aware that maintenance tasks themselves are potentially
                            hazardous and can result in injury. The successful maintenance program is:<br><br>
                            * well organized and scheduled,<br>
                           * controls hazards,<br>
                            * defines operational procedures, and<br>
                           *  trains key personnel.<br><br>

                           General requirements for tools and equipment maintenance include:<br><br>
                            * Obtaining a copy of the maintenance schedule recommended by the manufacturer<br>
                            * Ensuring that maintenance is performed as required<br>
                            * Ensuring that the person(s) performing the maintenance are competent (e.g. licensed
                            mechanic)<br>
                            * Retaining records of maintenance/service conducted<br>
                            * Specifying who is responsible for overseeing equipment maintenance and where the
                            records are kept.<br>
                           * Set up a system for removal and tagging of damaged or defective tools and
                            equipment.<br>

						<div class="full">
                          <p>To ensure that tools and equipment remain in good condition and last for a long time, store
                            them properly. Properly stored tools and equipment will be easy to find when needed and
                            are less likely to be lost.<br>
                            Good practices include:<br>
                            * Parts should be properly stored and labeled (Figure 1).<br>
                            * Tools should be properly placed on the board, and labeled (Figure 2). Consider
                            drawing the shapes of the tools on the board so that they always get put back in the
                            same position.<br>
                            * Use bins for storing small parts (Figure 3).<br>
                            * Consider making an individual (or individuals) responsible for the good maintenance
                            of tools and parts<br>

                            Benefits:<br>
                            * Tools and parts are kept in good condition and are easy to find<br>
                            * Costs are reduced.<br>
                            * Productivity is increased because time is not wasted looking for tools, parts and
                            equipment.<br>
                            * Workshop staff develop a sense of responsibility and pride in their work.<br>
